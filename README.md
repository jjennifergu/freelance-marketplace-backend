**Circus**
*Welcome to the Circus, you clown ðŸ¤¡*
*Connecting you with on campus freelancers.*
At the Circus, where Cornell students can post and purchase any jobs they would like to do or be done. For example, a user can offer a haircut for $25 and another user could purchase that service. The gig industry has become exceptionally popular in recent times with the rise of companies such as Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Fiverr, and such, and we hope to bring this to Cornell.

**Description**
We wrote routes to implement creating, editing, removing, purchasing, and getting listings, only accessible to users who are authenticated. Furthermore, related to users, we wrote routes to create, edit, and getting users (accounts). Authentication is used throughout. To make things easier, we also implemented different ways to getting specific users as well, by session_token, and by username.

We maintain a Users table and a Listings table. A user could be a seller or a buyer. A seller has a one-to-many relationship with listings, as a listing can only have one seller. A buyer has a many-to-many relationship with listings, as a listing could be purchased by multiple buyers and a buyer can purchase multiple listings. Our association table enables the many-to-many relationship. With these relationships established we are also able to allow users to purchase listings as well.
